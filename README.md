# for loop 
This program demonstrates a for loop written in C++. 
We use the headers include iostream, include string, and using namespace std.
In the main function we first ask the user how many numbers they want to enter. The user then inputs a number and we change it to an integer.
When the user enters this number we recognize it as the integer "count".
We intialize the integer "total" to 0
Then we start the for loop.
The initial statement initializes the control variable "x" to 0.
The loop condition states the as long as the control variable "x" is less than the number the user inputed we continue looping.
The update statement then adds one to the control variable "x".
We then ask the user to input another number, which we recognize as integer "next_number".
Then add "next_number" to "total" and the sum becomes the new "total.
This loops through as long as "x" is less than "count".
